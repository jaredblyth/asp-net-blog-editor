These two modules are separate but work together. 

Blog Editor allows a user to create blog entries into a SQLServer database. It has a cookie-based security system that requires the user to login with a password before making any changes. 

Users can use the ckEditor to write rich text without needing to know HTML or CSS. Malicious code is automatically stripped to prevent "SQL injections".

Set up instructions for blogeditor can be found in https://github.com/jaredblyth/asp-net-blog-editor/blob/master/blogeditor/setup/

Members allows website visitors to register as a member and then log-in to view the blog entries. (Alternatively, entries can be displayed on a public website instead).

Set up instructions for members can be found in https://github.com/jaredblyth/asp-net-blog-editor/blob/master/members/setup/

These modules can be used as the basis of any Content Management System (CMS) in the .NET environment. They have been tested in .NET 4.5

I have also built a version of Blog Editor for PHP that stores the data in a MySQL database. https://github.com/jaredblyth/php-blog-editor
